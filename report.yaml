abstract: |
  Computers are being put into more devices than ever and tools are required to verify and test the functionality of these devices. An important device used for testing is the logic analyzer which can read multiple digital signals at the same time. Reading multiple digital signals simultaneously allows people to decode different communication protocols and aids in debugging design problems.

  The logic analyzers currently on the market are either too expensive where they are out of reach of the hobbyist and student, or they are too low end where the specifications of the the device are too limited. The large test and measurement companies like Keysight and Tektronix have focused their logic analyzer product lines at the high speed sector with unit prices in the multiples of thousands of dollars and their devices are locked to their own custom closed source software. While there are open source logic analyzers on the market, they are mostly abandoned and have limited hardware that diminishes their ability to capture meaningful data.

  We aim to fix the problems in the logic analyzer sector by releasing a fully open source, open hardware logic analyzer that is integrated into the cross platform, open source test and measurement application Sigrok. Our device will be designed to meet industry needs with a superspeed USB 3.0 data connection for streaming data directly off of the device, enough memory to store large amounts of acquired data, and +/- 12V tolerant inputs which will allow for debugging almost any data connection from the past three decades.  We will also design our system with unused space in the FPGA to allow for future modifications and optimizations.
