# Tools and Standards #

## Tools Used ##

<!-- [This section specifies the selected hardware/software tools for use. Please specify why you selected these tools, and where and how these tools were used.] -->

Due to this project focusing on open source and contributing to the open source ecosystem, we also heavily used open source tools to verify our work. From the version control software we used, to the hardware verification we did.

### Git ###

Source code version control is an incredibly important part of every project, and for our projected we decided to go with git. Git is the most used version control software in the open source community and is widely used in industry as well. It only made sense to use something that other people would be familiar with using so that in the future they would be able to contribute to the project with very little friction.
